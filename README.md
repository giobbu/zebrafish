# COLLECTIVE MOTION IN ZEBRAFISHES
### Data
The data have been obtained using idtracker.ai. The data are related to trajectories for 60, 80 and 100 fish. Each subfolder has as a name the number of individuals in the trajectories.

### Zebrafish data analysis:
* Fishes probability density within tank
* Cosine similarity among fishes to assess how parallel are all fish to each other

## ML model to predict fish trajectories
* LSTM/GRU for multi-step ahead fish trajectory prediction
